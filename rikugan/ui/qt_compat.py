"""Qt binding surface for Rikugan.

Rikugan targets IDA Pro ≥ 9.0, which ships PySide6 (Qt6) as its sole Qt
binding. (IDA 9.x also exposes a legacy Qt5-named module, but it is a
thin shim that delegates to PySide6 — not a separate binding.) Rikugan
imports PySide6 directly and never relies on that shim.

This module is the primary import seam for Qt symbols across the
package. Most call sites import from ``rikugan.ui.qt_compat`` rather
than from ``PySide6`` directly, so a future host binding swap (e.g.
PySide7) should only require editing this one file. A few theme modules
(``rikugan/ui/theme/manager.py``, ``palette_ida.py``, ``watcher.py``)
import ``PySide6`` directly behind a ``try/except ImportError`` so the
headless/non-Qt path can skip them; consolidating those is future work.

Previously this module also supported an alternative binding via runtime
detection. That detection was the root cause of the IDA 9.1 crash: when
another plugin had pre-imported the alternative, detection picked it
while the host still ran PySide6, producing mismatched widget types in
widget constructors
(``QVBoxLayout(QWidget): argument 1 has unexpected type
'PySide6.QtWidgets.QWidget'``). The alternative binding has been removed
entirely.
