"""Cached Anthropic authentication resolution.

Avoids repeated subprocess spawns for OAuth token discovery by caching
the first successful result at module level.  This is the single authority
for auth resolution — both UI and provider construction go through here.

The anthropic_provider module (and its OAuth keychain subprocess machinery)
is only imported when auth is actually resolved, not when auth_cache is
first imported.  This keeps auth_cache import cheap.
