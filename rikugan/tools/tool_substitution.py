"""Suggest dedicated tools when an ``execute_python`` script is just a wrapper.

When the agent reaches for ``execute_python`` to reimplement
``ida_nalt.get_import_module_qty()`` (which is what ``list_imports``
does), the user pays for an extra approval round-trip and we lose the
benefit of pagination, caching, and the description the dedicated tool
already shows the model. This module catches that pattern and emits a
non-blocking suggestion the LLM can act on.

Design choices
--------------
- **Suggest-only.** We never block execution. The agent may have a
  legitimate reason to script (filtering, batch processing, custom
  formatting); we just make the dedicated-tool option visible.
- **AST-based.** Regex over the raw source would yield too many
  false positives (string literals, comments, docstrings, variable
  names). Walking the AST only matches actual call sites.
- **Module-level mapping table.** Adding new suggestions is a one-line
  change in ``_API_PATTERNS`` — no need to touch the scanner.

The mapping table in this file is the business logic: it encodes
"this IDAPython call sequence is equivalent to that dedicated tool".
It is contribution-driven because it depends on IDAPython muscle
memory that varies by reverse-engineer.
