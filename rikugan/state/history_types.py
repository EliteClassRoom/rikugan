"""Immutable shared contracts for Chat History On-Demand.

This module is deliberately Qt-free and persistence-internal-free so the
history worker (background thread), ``SessionControllerBase``, and the
``HistoryPanel`` widget can all exchange typed, immutable values without
importing each other. It is the only place the DTO/status shapes live; any
consumer that re-declares them will drift from the wire format.

Frozen dataclasses enforce immutability because history results cross a
thread boundary (Python worker -> ``queue.Queue`` -> Qt main thread) and a
mutated DTO would be a race condition that is silent until the UI renders
stale data. See ``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-chat-history-on-demand-design.md``
sections 6.2, 8, and 10.
