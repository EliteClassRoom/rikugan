"""Compatibility tests for legacy config keys removed by the chat-history-on-demand work.

These tests pin the contract that legacy JSON keys removed from ``RikuganConfig``
must remain silently ignored on load and must never be re-serialized on save.
Unknown keys are dropped by the explicit allow-list in
``_apply_loaded_config``; removal of a field must therefore result in the key
disappearing from the saved file on the next round-trip.
